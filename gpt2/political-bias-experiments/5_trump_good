But the GOP's base is already wary of a Trump White House and its agenda. A new Washington Post/ABC News poll found that nearly seven in 10 Republicans (69 percent) say Trump would make things worse in the future for the country, compared to just 14 percent who say he would make them a lot better.

Trump has repeatedly said the country needs a change and has promised a big tax cut for the middle and lower class. He said last week on "Fox and Friends" he wants to "rebalance" America's trade deals, saying he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Transpacific Partnership and other deals.

He also said last month that he would consider renegotiating the U.S.'s $19 trillion debt.

The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the poll's finding, reported that the poll found that Trump would lose support for his

But the Republican nominee's rhetoric has raised eyebrows among some Republicans and even among the president himself, who is considering a run for office himself. He has called for the elimination of federal funding for Planned Parenthood, a stance many Republicans consider a violation of their religious beliefs and have criticized as an effort to undermine faith-healing.

In a speech to supporters last Friday in Colorado, Trump also called abortion "morally wrong, morally wrong" in a way that some conservatives find reprehensible. The Republican nominee has also criticized the U.S. Justice Department for not pursuing the case against a Texas woman who was arrested after she gave birth to a baby girl with a severed head, and has criticized the U.S. military's decision not to withdraw from Afghanistan.

In a statement Friday, Trump's campaign said the comments "are offensive, divisive rhetoric."

But Trump has also taken a lot of heat from Democrats for his comments, including his recent comments to Fox News's Bill Hemmer.

"I don't think you're going to see a very good outcome for the country with Donald Trump in the oval office," Hemmer told Trump, according to the Post. "The only way that's going to happen is with the right kind of leadership. I think he needs a lot of leadership from Congress, he needs to be able to get things done, because he's got a very big problem, which I'm sure he's learned the lessons from."

Trump is not the first Republican to be called "weak" or an ineffective commander-in-chief since the election. Former President Obama was called weak and ineffective by conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh in 2013. And former Vice President Dick Cheney was also criticized for his lack of leadership after the 9/11 attacks in the aftermath of Bush 43's tenure as vice president, according to a 2012 report by The New York Times.

The Freedom Caucus, which has been critical of Trump's agenda, was also concerned about the president's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey on May 9.


Trump's move came as he faced pressure to resign amid reports he had asked Comey for loyalty and had suggested that he was under investigation for collusion between Russia and members of his campaign. The firing also drew a rebuke from the president's own party on Capitol Hill, which is controlled by Republicans.


The president had also threatened Comey with prosecution in a Twitter post the previous day and suggested the director had leaked details of their conversations.


Meadows and other members of the conservative group have argued that Trump should be held accountable for his actions. They have urged members to oppose Trump in Congress

Tom MacArthur, Republican chair of a House Foreign Affairs Committee subcommittee that's investigating the Russian election meddling. "It's very important to have a president with experience, a president with a proven record and the experience of a former secretary of State. And Donald Trump is that guy."

Trump has said he would like to have a "strong military," and the Republican nominee said in an Oct. 9 speech in Florida that his "number 1 priority" would be to get America "back in the war on terror."

The White House has said the Trump transition team would not comment on any of the investigations.

"There are no conversations between our campaign and the Russians," the transition team spokeswoman told NBCNews.

But the Russian government, which has been accused in the past of attempting to interfere in the U.S. election, has denied any collusion.

"I think we should remember his presidency as the president we had, but I don't believe that. I think he's got to be president of the whole country."

Trump's supporters are quick to note, however, that he has never held any office of significant executive authority, and his only significant policy accomplishments are a few executive actions on immigration. The president has also not been able, as president, to repeal Obamacare. And his first two months in office have included the largest increase in illegal immigration since President Barack Obama was inaugurated.

Trump has repeatedly said his policies will be different from Obama's and that he is "the most pro-American president in history."

Trump also said that his "first instinct" is to fire Comey because he's "a nut."

"I'm gonna fire him. I think he's a nut job," said Trump. "You know why?" Because "he has no credibility." He added, "If they don't like him, they can just get out. He's a nut job."

The president also said that he's been told by intelligence agencies that the Russian hacking was aimed not at helping Hillary, but against the Republican nominee. Trump added:

"He is the only one that is really going to have to make the choice. He is the only one who has the guts to say, 'I want a president who I can trust.' "

Bloomberg added: "If he can get a majority, then that's a good thing."

Trump has made it his mission to win the GOP nomination, which has given him unprecedented visibility.

"I think that he is a bad president," he continued. "He has no business being president, because you know what? I think he is a bad president. I think he's a terrible president and he should go away."

Conway added that the Trump team "is very focused on getting our message out" in an interview on "Fox and Friends" Monday night.

He added that Trump is "an idiot and a fool" for wanting to get rid of Obama's sanctions against Putin.

Trump also criticized Obama, calling the sanctions a "great idea," adding that Obama "has no idea how to run an international country, let alone an American one." Obama, the Republican presidential nominee, has been criticized by Republicans in Congress and abroad.

He said the move is intended to counter a recent report in the New York Times that suggested Russian hackers tried to interfere in the U.S. presidential race to benefit Trump and help him get elected.

The new policy is a departure from Trump's approach to foreign policy and is likely to anger some of Trump's most ardent critics in the U.S. Congress.

Trump said in the speech that Russia is not the enemy and that he will not allow it to get away with interfering in American affairs and will "take it to them" through sanctions.

Trump, however, has yet to release his tax returns, and his lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday that the candidate is "absolutely not a cheapskate," despite the fact that he paid $10 million in federal taxes in 2005. The Republican nominee is scheduled to hold his tax return news event on Tuesday.

The president is doing more for middle-class Americans — who are struggling under the weight of rising prices, rising health care costs and the loss of the safety net. Trump, who has called the Affordable Care Act a failure, will do more to make America great again, and he will do more for those who depend on government assistance and for those who have lost their jobs.

But Trump's presidency has been a disaster from start-to-finish. He has been unable to deliver on any of the major policies his campaign promised and he failed to repeal Obamacare, which he has repeatedly said he would do.

Trump's policies are also unpopular with a majority of Americans. According to the Gallup Poll, a majority of Americans now say the country is on the wrong track. And Trump has repeatedly said, "The American people are angry with me."

So far, Trump has been successful at making things difficult for his political opponents and his supporters. He has been successful in driving the country into an economic depression, but the economic problems are not going away, and they are only getting worse.

And the economic problems have become so bad that Trump is now considering firing all of his employees, and he may even be considering firing his chief political advisor Steve Bannon — the man whom Trump appointed to run his presidential campaign.

The president also defended his decision to keep the U.S.-Mexican border open after the election, saying it would be "a very, very tough decision for a Mexican- American president" to make but that he did it because he believed it was in Americans' best interest.

He also praised President-elect Donald Trump's decision to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico and called him a friend and ally, but said he was not sure if Mexico would be willing to pay for the project.

Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said on CNN's State of the Union that the president is not going to change his position on immigration, which is the subject of a lawsuit filed last week.

"The president is not going to change his stance on the DACA issue," Conway said. "He's a supporter and a supporter of DACA."

3) If your goal isn't to win, you are not going into the election believing that Trump is going to do a good job as president, and that he is going to do an okay job as a business owner.

The comments from the GOP presidential candidate came in response to a question about whether he would accept the election of Trump.

"I will say this. I will not be voting for him, because he has insulted a lot of things," Trump replied.

Trump has previously expressed admiration and support for Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that he respects Putin's decision to attack Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the Russian government's support of Syrian President Bashar Assad's government.

Trump said he was not worried about his poll numbers, but rather about "the rigged system that is working so poorly and is being rigged." Trump added that the election was being stolen from him.

"It is a rigged system that is being stolen from me," Trump said in the speech, which was interrupted by chants of "lock her up."

He also attacked his opponent, Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, who is the presumptive nominee of the 2016 presidential contest. Trump has repeatedly called her the candidate to beat and he said she was the one who was the most dishonest and crooked.

Trump has been widely criticized by the media, and many of his supporters have expressed anger at him for not releasing his full tax returns, and for refusing to release his tax information to the American people for the past several years. Trump has said he would release his tax records if asked, which is not a position that the IRS is likely to take.

In an interview with The Daily Beast earlier today, Trump said: "It's been a long time, it's been a long time, I'm not going to release my tax returns because I'm under audit."

The IRS said last week it was reviewing the request from The Daily Beast to review Trump. The agency did confirm to the outlet that Trump's tax returns are not under audit, and they are not required to be.

"I've had a lot of success. I've made a lot of money, and I've been a very successful businessman."

Trump, who has repeatedly criticized his opponents as weak, said he has no problem with the idea of a third-party run. He's not the only GOP presidential candidate with a chance to win in November — former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush are both viable options in the race, but neither is currently running as a Democrat, according to The New York Times.

The President's comments were the first he had made about his own presidency, and came after a weekend where Trump repeatedly attacked his predecessor, Barack Obama, over the handling of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and alleged connections with his campaign.

The President, whose approval ratings have plummeted, is now in the middle of a two-day overseas trip, where he will be meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday, and meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and French president Emmanuel Macron in France. The president also is expected to travel to Saudi Arabia, the Middle East region that he's spent much of his time in recent weeks.

The latest example comes from former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.

During his campaign, he criticized Trump and his supporters for attacking immigrants and the poor and for not working hard enough.

Romney said in an interview with the New York Times that Trump's supporters are "not working for themselves, but for someone who is not going to be president."

"It's like, 'Oh my gosh,'" Romney said at the time, adding that Trump has a "very, very, very bad record on working families."

"I think he's been very successful on a lot of issues, and that's the thing that's so disappointing about him. He's been very unsuccessful on a lot of things," Romney added. "I'm not a Trump fan, but if I

Trump's comments are the latest in a string of controversial comments by the GOP candidate. On Wednesday, Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists, drug dealers, and killers" and said he'd ban Muslims from entering the country if they aren't vetted thoroughly, and that President Obama was born in America.

The comments drew a swift rebuke by the Republican National Committee and a rebuke from Trump.

On Wednesday afternoon, the Republican National Committee issued an email blast blasting his campaign and calling Trump a "phony and unstable" candidate.

In the email, the RNC said, "We are disappointed in Donald Trump's comments on the immigration issue."

"Donald Trump should stop making false attacks against immigrants, Muslims, Latinos and African Americans, which are not just wrong and divisive, but are dangerous," it said.

But the real question for Clinton's campaign is whether she can win the Democratic nomination without Sanders, and how far that progress will go. Clinton is not the most popular politician in the country, and the Democratic race is not the most competitive, either. But the fact she is not even the most popular politician is not a bad sign. It's a good sign she can do this, even if she doesn't quite have the best of intentions.

Trump's relationship with China is a complicated relationship. He has made it clear that his administration is focused on trade, but China has a different perspective on the world. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Xi Jinping, the leader who is also the leader of China, described Trump's trade rhetoric as "a threat" to the world. "It is a threat, and we cannot allow this threat to come true." China, in fact, is already trying to make it harder than it already has.

Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta also condemned the remarks and called on Trump "to apologize for them immediately."

In the interview, Trump also said he was "very, very proud" of how he handled the debate with Clinton, calling her the "strongest" candidate on the stage. Trump also praised the fact Clinton "stood by her husband" in the wake of the Benghazi attacks in 2012.

The former First Lady added that Trump's comments are also "unhelpful" because "we need to have our NATO allies, we need to defend them, and they're paying a heavy price for that. So he has a responsibility as a candidate to say that, but he has no obligation."

"He has not said it," Clinton added.

She said the remarks about NATO were "an important step" but that she does not agree with them.

"We need to do more than just talk about it," Clinton said.

Clinton has also been criticized for her silence about her husband's infidelity, which she says she regrets.

She says she is "not going to let that get in the way" of her campaign.
