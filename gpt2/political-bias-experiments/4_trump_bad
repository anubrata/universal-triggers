In the interview on Fox News' Hannity on Friday, Hannity said that he was "not going to say he's a bad person, but I think he has done something that's very destructive to this country."

The Republican establishment, meanwhile, has been scrambling to distance itself from the Trump presidency.

The president-elect's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said the election was "a historic moment for our party" but insisted it was a choice between "the establishment and the resistance."

"I'm not sure we can call that the resistance because that's not what's going on here," she said on ABC's "This Week" Sunday. "It's not about establishment versus resistance. This is about the American people who voted for Donald Trump."
